# Learning Philosophy

## Objective
This repository documents my hands-on cybersecurity learning journey with a focus on practical skills, professional documentation, and continuous improvement.

## Approach
I treat learning as a job, not a hobby. Each lab or exercise results in written artifacts that reflect both successes and gaps.

## Principles
- Document facts over opinions
- Focus on detection, response, and impact
- Sanitize sensitive details
- Emphasize lessons learned and mitigation

## Goals
- Build strong blue team fundamentals
- Develop clear technical communication skills
- Create tangible evidence of capability for employers
