# First Lab Notes 

## Context
This document marks the beginning of my hands-on cybersecurity learning documentation. The goal is to practice professional write-ups and establish consistency.

## What I’m Learning
- Basic cybersecurity terminology
- How labs are structured
- How to document actions clearly

## Initial Observations
- Writing forces me to slow down and think
- I notice gaps in understanding faster when documenting
- Even simple tasks benefit from structure

## Next Steps
- Complete first TryHackMe room
- Replace this document with a formal investigation-style write-up
